# Data-Analysis
This project was undertaken to explore various functions of NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. A sample sales dataset was used for analysis. The data underwent cleaning and preprocessing, followed by grouping based on various fields to extract meaningful insights.

To enhance data understanding, multiple visualizations were created using Matplotlib. These visualizations helped in identifying trends, patterns, and key business metrics, providing a clearer picture of the sales performance.

Through this project, different data manipulation and visualization techniques were explored, showcasing the power of Python libraries in handling and analyzing data effectively. However, the project is still ongoing and requires the addition of many more features to complete the analysis
